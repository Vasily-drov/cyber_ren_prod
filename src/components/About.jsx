                        Renaissance itself wasn’t only about brilliant artists and philosophers.
                        It was also about philanthropists and benefactors who supported all these geniuses and together were making a difference in the world.
                        There’s no shortage of money to do the sorts of things they did,
                        but what’s holding us back today is a shortage of vision.
                        The Renaissance would never be remembered if it’s leading members had simply made piles of cash. No one cares about that for any length of time.
                        We believe we should try to generate a cyber renaissance in our own societies. And we can start making that difference with NFTemple.
